## Install

### Development
Node 10 or above is recommended. You will need the Yarn package manager.
Run 

`yarn install`

`npx babel-node --config-file babel.config.json`

This will compile files in /src to the out directory, which can be used in production.

### Test
Test files using the tests in /tests, using the Jest test driver.

`yarn test`

**Remember to build your files before you test!**
